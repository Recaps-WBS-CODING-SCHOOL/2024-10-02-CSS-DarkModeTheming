# CSS Only Dark Mode and Color Theming

In this repo you can find examples for

- a Dark/Light Mode switch, using a checkbox hack and the `:has()` s
- a select to switch between light, dark and system default
- the CSS `light-dark()` function
- color mixing `background-color: color-mix(in oklch, blue, yellow);`
- usage of CSS Custom Properties
- `@scope` and `@import` rules to componentize CSS
- a tailwind-like color palette derived from a base color via CSS relative color syntax
